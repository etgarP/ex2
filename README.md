# Exercise 2: Advanced Coding 2

Exercise 2 for Advanced Coding 2 focuses on migrating WhotsApps(TM) HTML and CSS pages to a React framework using JavaScript. The result is a fully functional client-based website.

## Pages

1. **Index Page**: This page serves as a sign-in page where users can log in to the site after registering. It verifies the entered username and password against the stored credentials.

2. **Register Page**: Here, users can register for the site. The page validates the input and provides feedback when incorrect information is provided.

3. **Chat Page**: Users can create new fictional contacts to chat with and send them messages. It also allows users to switch between different contacts and log out.

## How to Run the Code

To run this code, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `whatsapp` folder.
2. Add the `node_modules` folder that you obtained from React.
3. Open the command prompt and execute the command `npm start`.

Enjoy exploring the functionality of the new WhotsApp(TM) website!
